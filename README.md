Analysis of Food Delivery Services 🛵

I conducted an internal review focusing on seven key performance indicators (KPIs) and performed a comprehensive analysis of competitors to formulate a precise growth optimization roadmap.

Despite the successful growth of our (fictitious) company, the recent emergence of new delivery services in Graz has intensified competition. Responding to the strategy team's request, I carried out a competitor analysis to aid in developing an accurate roadmap for optimizing growth.
